## This API is serving Heliocentric planet coordinates computed for a specific Time of Interest

It uses the [astronomy-bundle](https://github.com/andrmoel/astronomy-bundle-js) package by Andreas MÃ¶ller. Since it is written in Typescript with ES6 syntax, the use of an ECMA-module loader like [ESM](https://github.com/standard-things/esm) is required (or a transpiler like babel).

This nodeJS app is running on free dynos on Heroku at [https://astro.cgmsim.com](https://astro.cgmsim.com). It doesn't require credentials.
